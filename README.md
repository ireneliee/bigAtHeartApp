# Big at Heart Web Applications

## Overview
We have developed two lightweight web applications using Google App Script, with the integrated database housed in Google Sheets. 

## Technologies Used
- **Google App Script**: Rapid development capabilities and seamless integration with Google's storage solutions.
- **Google Sheets**: Database storage for both applications.

## Features

### Admin Portal
The first application serves as an admin portal, enabling administrators to:
- Access detailed volunteer information.
- Create various volunteering events, workshops, and trainings.

### Volunteer Portal
The second application functions as a volunteer portal, providing volunteers with the ability to:
- Reserve their spots for volunteering events.
- Browse through and interact with other users' blogs.
- Create their own reflection blog posts.
